If you have a good idea for a project that falls within my areas of expertise, shoot me an e-mail and we can discuss the idea and whether you want me as your supervisor. I currently have no open projects in need of a student, but I’m always up for discussion any ideas you might have.\nAre you dreaming of becoming a PhD student?
