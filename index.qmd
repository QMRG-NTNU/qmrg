[The Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG)](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/psychology/the-quantitative-methods-research-group) is a specialized research group which centers on the development and advanced applications of quantitative methods and statistical modelling for the psychological sciences. The QMRG is based in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.ntnu.edu/psychology) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu). 

Our main goal is to produce and disseminate knowledge about quantitative methods and statistical modelling through teaching, research, publications, and programming applications and software packages for quantitative data analysis.
